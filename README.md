# G6 Pokedex

### IST 659 - Data Admin Concepts (Syracuse University)

Our team has created a database using Sequel that allows users to track Pokémon caught in the video games and query the database to see the stats of Pokémon.
A user can query the database by Pokémon name, type, base stat(s), etc. 
Pokémon can also be added to a saved list for quicker accessibility.

In this repository you can find the SQL file used for upserting the database, and the PDF file containing the final report.
The PDF file contains a written process of creating the database, as well as mockups for a running application.
